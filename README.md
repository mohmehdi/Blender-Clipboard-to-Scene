### Blender Clipboard to Scene


---

**It doesn't work with version 2.93 and higher**  
(I tested it on 2.91 and 2.83)  
There is an issue with importing the Pillow module 

---

### What does this do:
It makes it very easy for you to import images from clipboard by making a folder next to your blend file and adding the images that you would like to add to it   
_There is also an option to delete the folder_

## How to Install:  

1. Add [PIL or pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to your Blender folder here: `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.91\2.91\python\lib` or in `\scripts\modules`     
2. go to Edit-> Preferences -> Add-ons and click install then select the `add image.py` file
3. enable  the add on
4. well, first you need to download all of those things 

### How to Use this:
::in order to use this add-on you need to enable blenders built in `Import Images as Planes` add-on first::  
location to this add on is `View3D > Sidebar > Add_Image` panel  
this will save all images added to the scene next to your blend file so make sure to **save your blend file**
